# Food Recipes

This is an online recipe book of three foods:
Chicken Noodle Soup
Macaroni and Cheese
Fried Rice

This project has increased by my knowledge and understanding of web design.
I have gained the ability to:
Create links
Get images
Use git commits
Make ordered and unordered lists

Overall, this was a great starter project. It wasn't tedious and just the right length.
I have a better handle on things going forward.
